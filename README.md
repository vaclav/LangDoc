# LangDoc
MPS language documentation language

The LangDoc allows arbitrary nodes in your models to be annotated with documentation text. Import the LangDoc language into your model to be able to annotate your code with documentation text. The documentation text can be multi-line styled text, optionally with embedded pieces of code or references to code. Intentions are used to conveniently manipulate the documentation. The default projection shows the actual documentation text in the Inspector. An alternative projection shows it directly in the editor above the documented node. The user switches between the two notations with a new action in the View menu.
